# surfs_up
Module 9
## Project Overview
In this project we wanted to start a theoretical surf shop in Hawaii. We used jupyter notebooks to create base statistics for the weather data for the months of june and december. Then compared the two statistics to see if the surf shop is in the ideal location. We used the motnhs of June and December to see the opposite times of year i.e. summer and winter.
## Analysis
### Overview
The summary Statistics for the months of June and December can be seen below. Each has the appropiate title. These statistics can help decide if this is the ideal location for a surf shop.
#### Graphs for June and December

### Results
* In the summary statistics we can see the mean is about 4 degrees less than the mean in june.
* the standard deviation in December is 3.7 whereas the standard deviation in june is 3.26
* the max temperature is 2 degrees higher in June than in December and the min is 8 degrees higher in June when compared to December.
### Summary
Based on the summary statistics we can say that this could be an ideal location for a surf shop. The mean in June was 4 degrees higher than december and i would say this is reasonable range for surfing and ice cream year round. The standard deviation listed above means the temperature fluctuates a little more in December but stays the ideal temperature for the most part. There is not much difference in the max temperature for the 2 months but the min is significatly lower when comparing the 2. We could run additional queries to get more data on the location such as rainfall in each month. Another additional query could be the cloudiness.
