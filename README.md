Module 9
## Project Overview
In this project we wanted to start a theoretical surf shop in Hawaii. We used jupyter notebooks to create base statistics for the weather data for the months of june and december. Then compared the two statistics to see if the surf shop is in the ideal location. We used the motnhs of June and December to see the opposite times of year i.e. summer and winter.
